  views__site__index__intro: "The competition was based on team performance, involving 6 teams. Points were allocated based on electricity saved compared against a 'baseline' week that started on 31st January. The team saving the most electricity from the previous week was awarded 6 points, reducing to 1 point for team with the least saving. The  winning team(s) for February was Birmingham and Plovdiv 2; for March it was Ivanovo; who were also the winners in April and therefore the team that saved the most electricity between 31st January and 25th April.  Congratulations to Ivanovo, and 'well done' and thanks to all households who took part; hopefully everyone is a winner if they have managed to save energy."

  views__site__view_team__intro: "Points are calculated based on the percentage of electricity saved compared to the previous week in each participating household.  This starting point was a 'baseline' week, commencing 31st January, where each household's usage was noted. Thereafter the household who reduces usage the most (compared to the previous week) is awarded 5 points reducing to 1 point for the household making the least saving each week.  The achievements of all households within a team are then compared to the other 5 regional teams to assess the leading team(s)."
